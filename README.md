# Prototype page for the BioDeepTime project

The page is deployed as https://biodeeptime.github.io. 

I drafted this quickly to show what this can be like. 

The site uses jekyll with the bulma-clean-theme. 

The `main` has the source files. The page is deplyed **MANUALLY** from the `gh-pages` branch. (e.g separate offline repository in the _site directory where jekyll builds)
