The BioDeepTime working group (funded by the Paleosynthesis Project) seeks to address one of the central challenges in biodiversity science by compiling and harmonizing ecological time series from modern and fossil sources to investigate how biological responses to environmental change vary across timescales ranging from months to millions of years. The working group formed in 2020 and continues to pursue questions related to temporal dynamics of biodiversity using neontological and paleontological records in the BioDeepTime database and beyond.
