The majority of our group met between April 8 and 12 in Leipzig (Germany) at the iDiv to discuss the next phase of our project. [The workshop]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/team/workshops/) focused on the development of our already running projects, the use of eco-evolutionary models and ideas about data gathering.
